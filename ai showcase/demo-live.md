## Step 0: ICP Sharpening

### Refined ICP

**Who you're targeting:**
Solo founders building B2B SaaS, developer tools, hoặc prosumer products — giai đoạn pre-launch đến ~100 users. Người đang tự làm distribution, không có growth team, không có budget ads.

**The pain, in their words:**
- "i spent 3 hours on reddit today and found nothing relevant"
- "my post got removed for self-promotion and i don't even know what i did wrong"
- "i wrote a reply, got 2 upvotes, zero clicks on the link"
- "chatgpt keeps giving me replies that sound like ads"
- "i don't know if it's my product or my messaging that's the problem"

**What they're using today instead:**
- **ChatGPT/generic prompts** — generates replies that get downvoted because they don't know Reddit tone rules (no em dash awareness, sounds like marketing copy)
- **Manual research** — 3 hours finding threads, no system, same effort every week doesn't compound
- **Growth guides / courses** — static, generic, not adapted to the specific product or ICP

**Your offer:**
Open-source — it's free, paste it into Claude or ChatGPT and run it

# Community Seeding Playbook: first-1000-users

---

## 0. Start Here — Week 1

**Highest-signal platform this week:** Reddit — specifically r/indiehackers and r/microsaas, where the exact pain phrases ("post got removed", "spent hours and found nothing") appear multiple times per week from the exact ICP.

**Your 5 actions this week, in order:**

1. **Reddit** → Search: `"reddit posts" "getting removed" OR "self promotion" site:reddit.com/r/indiehackers` + `reddit.com/search?q=how+do+i+find+first+users&sort=new&t=week`
   → When you find a match: Reply publicly
   → What to do: Answer the workflow question with something genuinely useful (specific search query tip, or platform tone observation) first — product last sentence only
   → Time needed: ~20 min

2. **Reddit** → Search: `reddit.com/search?q=chatgpt+reddit+reply+downvoted&sort=new&t=week` + `r/microsaas`: `finding first users`
   → When you find a match: Reply + DM if it's a personal frustration post (first-person, emotional register)
   → What to do: Reply publicly with the fix (intent-phrase search vs topic search), DM with the skill as one natural option
   → Time needed: ~20 min

3. **HN** → Submit Show HN: `"Show HN: first-1000-users – paste your product spec, get a complete community seeding playbook (open source)"`
   → Write 2–3 sentences in the submission body about what the ICP sharpening step does and why — that's the interesting part for HN
   → Time needed: ~30 min

4. **X** → Search: `"reddit" "self promotion" -filter:replies min_faves:5` + `"my post got removed" reddit`
   → When you find a match: Reply only — one specific observation about why it happened
   → Time needed: ~10 min

5. **Slack (Indie Hackers)** → Join #growth or #distribution → Search: `reddit` + `community outreach` + `first users`
   → When you find a match: Reply in thread, DM only if it's a personal struggle message (not a general question)
   → Time needed: ~20 min

**One thing NOT to do this week:**
Don't submit to r/indiehackers as a "Show & Tell" post before having 2–3 genuine replies in the community. First-time posters with a product link get ignored or removed. Build presence first.

**What to track:**
- [ ] Threads found that matched your signals
- [ ] Replies sent
- [ ] DMs sent
- [ ] Responses received

Bring these numbers back after 20 interactions — I'll adjust the strategy.

### Hacker News

**Ask HN search queries:**
- `"first users" founder` on hn.algolia.com — surfaces recurring "how I got my first 100 users" Ask HN threads
- `"community" "seeding" startup` — lower volume, high intent
- `"distribution" "solo"` — hits product-ICP overlap threads

**Show HN strategy:**
- Timing: Tuesday or Wednesday morning, 9–11am US ET (peak HN engagement)
- Title: `"Show HN: first-1000-users — AI skill that generates a community seeding playbook from your product spec"`
- Body: Lead with the ICP sharpening mechanic — that's the HN-interesting part. "Most AI prompts take your spec and output generic advice. This one challenges the ICP first before generating anything." Then link.
- Expect: Technical feedback on the skill logic, questions about platform detection, skepticism about effectiveness — engage all of it seriously.

**Comment opportunities:**
- Any "how did you get your first users" thread (recurs every 6–8 weeks)
- Any thread about "AI for marketing" or "LLM for growth"
- Any "what I wish I knew about distribution" thread

**Tone notes:** No marketing language. Product gets one line at the end. Lead with a substantive observation about *why* community seeding fails (pattern-match to marketing language, wrong platform tone, no signal detection system) — make the comment stand alone without the link.

### Pain Point — "spent hours on reddit finding nothing / posts getting removed"

**Variant 1: Experience-based — Reddit**
> yeah i went through this exact phase. the problem is that reddit's search surfaces topic keywords, not intent signals, so you end up finding "reddit marketing" discussions instead of people mid-problem. what eventually worked was switching to first-person frustration phrases, like "i wish there was" or "i'm so tired of doing this manually" -- those surface people who are actually stuck right now, not people who already solved it. i built a skill file that maps this per platform, it's free and open source if that helps

**Variant 2: Comparison-based — Reddit**
> chatgpt gives you the same 5 reddit queries every time and none of them work because they're category keywords, not intent phrases. the difference is massive: "community seeding tool" gets you 4 year old threads, "i keep posting on reddit and no one clicks my link" gets you someone who posted yesterday. there's also a platform tone thing -- what flies on r/indiehackers gets removed on r/startups. i systematized this into a skill file, open source if you want it

**Variant 3: Problem-solving — Reddit**
> a few things that helped me: sort by "new" not "hot", use t=week filter, and search in first-person phrases not topic categories. also run the same search on reddit.com/search not through google -- the filters are more useful. the reason you want first-person phrases is you're looking for someone mid-frustration, not someone who already has the answer. i packaged this workflow up into a skill file if it's useful, happy to share

**Variant 4: Competitor-aware — Reddit**
> the issue with most AI-generated reddit reply workflows is that they don't know the platform-specific rules. reddit has some hard ones: em dashes get you downvoted, certain opener phrases get auto-removed, and the same reply that works in one subreddit is wrong tone for another. chatgpt doesn't know any of this, so the output reads like a blog post in a place where people write like they're texting. i built first-1000-users to handle exactly this, it's free: [link]

---

### Direct Request — "looking for a prompt/tool for community outreach"

**Variant 1: Experience-based — Reddit**
> i built something for this after spending a few months doing it manually with mixed results. the main problem i kept running into was that generic prompts don't account for platform tone, so the output worked fine on slack but got ignored on reddit because it read too formally. first-1000-users runs an ICP sharpening step first (catches vague product descriptions before they produce generic output), then maps communities and gives you exact search queries per platform. it's open source: [link], happy to share if useful

**Variant 2: Problem-solving — Reddit**
> a few things that separate useful prompts from generic ones for this: first, the prompt should challenge your ICP before writing anything, because vague inputs produce vague outputs. second, platform tone rules need to be explicit -- reddit, slack, hn, and x are completely different registers. third, it needs to give you signal-based search queries not just communities to join. i built a skill file that does all three, it's free if you want to try it

**Variant 3: Comparison-based — Slack**
> hey yeah, most generic AI prompts for this just give you template replies that work nowhere in particular. the thing that's different about platform-specific outreach is that reddit and hn have completely opposite tone expectations -- what sounds authoritative on hn reads like an ad on reddit. i built a skill file that has these rules built in, it's open source: [link]

**Variant 4: Competitor-aware — HN**
> The main failure mode of general-purpose LLM prompts for community outreach is that they optimize for "sounds helpful" rather than "fits the platform register." Reddit in particular has observable patterns that trigger downvotes even in otherwise quality comments — em dash usage, gerund openers, hedging language. The fix is explicit platform tone rules baked into the prompt, not general instructions to "be helpful." I've been building something that operationalizes this: [link]

---

### Comparison — "tried ChatGPT for reddit replies, too generic"

**Variant 1: Experience-based — Reddit**
> yeah this is exactly the problem, chatgpt defaults to a "content marketing" register that reddit detects immediately. i ran into this for months before figuring out it's not just the content, it's specific syntax things -- em dashes, certain opener phrases, writing in sentence fragments vs full paragraphs. i built a skill file that has the banned words and structural rules per platform baked in, completely changed the response rate. it's free and open source if you want to try it

**Variant 2: Problem-solving — X**
> ChatGPT writes community replies like blog posts. Reddit reads them as ads.
>
> The fix: give the model explicit tone rules — no em dashes, lowercase "i", no opener phrases that pattern-match to marketing.
>
> Built a skill file that does this: [link]

**Variant 3: Comparison-based — Reddit**
> the difference between a chatgpt output and something that actually works on reddit is usually 3 things: lowercase throughout, no em dashes (sounds weird but this is a real tell), and the product mentioned last not first. chatgpt doesn't know reddit culture, it knows what "good writing" looks like from training data. those are two different things. i packaged the platform-specific rules into a skill file, it's open source

**Variant 4: Competitor-aware — Reddit**
> tbh chatgpt does fine at the content part, the problem is it doesn't know the platform. like the same reply works completely differently on reddit vs hn vs slack -- hn wants technical depth and no marketing language at all, reddit wants casual peer tone and lowercase everything, slack is somewhere in between. chatgpt just writes one thing and it doesn't fit any of them well. i built first-1000-users specifically to handle platform tone per-reply, it's free: [link]

## 4. DM Templates

### Pain Point — Reddit DM (personal frustration post)

> hey, saw your post about spending 3 hours on reddit finding nothing -- i've been there. the thing that actually changed it for me was switching from topic keywords to intent phrases. searching "i wish there was a tool for" surfaces people who posted yesterday, vs "community seeding tool" which surfaces 4 year old threads. i built a skill file that maps these per platform plus gives you the exact tone rules per subreddit. it's free and open source. happy to share if useful, no worries if not

---

### Pain Point — Reddit DM (post got removed / downvoted)

> hey saw your post about getting removed in r/startups -- frustrating when you don't know why. usually it's one of a few specific things: opener phrases that pattern-match to promo, em dashes in the text (sounds weird but this is a real one reddit flags), or linking in the first comment wrong. i built a skill that has the banned words and structural rules per subreddit built in. it's free, happy to share if useful

---

### Direct Request — Slack DM

> hey [name], saw your message in #growth about finding a better prompt for reddit outreach. one thing that makes a big difference is that each platform has specific syntax rules that generic prompts don't know about -- what works on slack is wrong tone for reddit, and hn is completely different again. i built a skill file that maps the tone rules and search signal queries per platform, it's free and open source. happy to share the link if useful

---

### Comparison — Reddit DM (tried chatgpt, found it too generic)

> hey, saw your post about chatgpt replies feeling too polished for reddit. the main issue is that chatgpt defaults to a "well-written content" register, and reddit reads that as an ad. there are a few specific rules that fix it -- lowercase throughout, no em dashes, product mentioned last not first, certain opener phrases to avoid. i packaged all of this plus community mapping into a free skill file. happy to share if that's useful, no pressure

|----------|-------|----|------|
| Active thread asking "what prompt do you use" (20+ comments) | ✅ | | |
| Someone posts "spent 3 hours on reddit found nothing" (first-person, frustrated) | | ✅ | |
| Small thread, "looking for a community outreach tool" | | | ✅ |
| "chatgpt vs X for reddit replies" comparison thread | ✅ | ✅ | |
| "i wish there was a tool that writes platform-specific replies" | | ✅ | |
| X post explicitly inviting suggestions | | | ✅ |
| HN thread (any) | ✅ | | |

## 5. Platform Tone Guide

| Platform | Voice | Opening move | Product position | Red flags |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Reddit | Peer who's struggled with the same distribution problem | Give the actual fix first (specific search query tip, tone rule) | Last sentence — "i built something for this" | Em dashes, "The key insight is", opener phrases like "I noticed that" or "I wanted to share" |
| Slack | Helpful colleague who's tried this workflow | 1–2 sentence specific answer in thread | After adding value, not before | Pitching before helping, posting the same message in #growth and #distribution simultaneously |
| X | Opinionated practitioner who knows platform tone | One specific, non-hedged observation (not a thread) | Product only if directly relevant, positioned last | Reply-guy behavior, generic "great thread" replies, threads-as-ads |
| HN | Technical peer with genuine depth on distribution mechanics | Comment that stands alone without the link — explain *why* the failure mode happens | Last line only: "I've been working on something related: [link]" — or skip it entirely | "Great question!", marketing language, vague claims about what the skill does without showing the mechanic |

## 6. Ongoing Cadence

```
## first-1000-users — Distribution Cadence

### 30 minutes/day:
Every day:
→ Run 2 searches from Output 2 — rotate signals daily to cover all by Friday
→ Pain Point signal (< 48 hours old): DM that founder
→ Direct Request or Comparison signal: reply publicly + DM if it's a small thread
Weekly target: 3–5 replies, 2–3 DMs

### 2–3 hours/week (batch):
Tuesday: Reddit + Slack
→ r/indiehackers, r/microsaas, r/SaaS, IH Slack #growth
→ Reply to top 3 relevant threads
→ DM 1–2 fresh Pain Point posts (< 24 hours)

Thursday: X + HN
→ Search pain phrase signals on X
→ Reply to 1–2 X posts if there's a natural hook
→ 1 HN comment if a relevant thread is active that week
→ Check Show HN: answer every comment within 24 hours of submission

### Rules:
→ Same subreddit: max 2× per week
→ Same reply structure: don't use the same variant back-to-back in the same community
→ DM with no reply after 5 days: move on, do not follow up
→ Show HN: submit once, do not resubmit
→ r/ChatGPT and r/ClaudeAI: check monthly, not weekly
```

### When to Expand vs Double Down

```
Double down if: 1+ meaningful response per 5 DMs | replies getting upvotes | someone asks to try the skill
Expand if: r/indiehackers and r/microsaas feel saturated | same people replying
Pause if: 0 responses after 20 DMs | multiple replies removed from the same subreddit | warned by a mod
```

### After 20 interactions

Switch to **Check-in Mode** — paste your 6 data points (replies sent, upvotes/follow-ups, DMs sent, response rate, best platform, unexpected signals) and I'll return targeted adjustments only.
